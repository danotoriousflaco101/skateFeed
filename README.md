<h1>SkateFeed</h1>
<p>
<strong>Skateboarding news aggregator.</strong>
</p>
</div>

SkateFeed is a backend application built with Java and Spring Boot that acts as an intelligent news aggregator for the skateboarding world. The service monitors RSS feeds from industry websites, filters news based on users' preferred keywords, and sends email notifications.

This project was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of Spring Integration in orchestrating complex data flows in an elegant and decoupled way.
(but also to have myself a newsletter with filtered articles of skateboarders i love to follow without having to surf websites many times per week!)


üöÄ Key Features
---------------

REST API for Subscriptions: Exposes an endpoint to allow users to subscribe to the service, specifying their email address and a list of keywords of interest (e.g., "baker skateboards", "tiago lemos").


Periodic RSS Feed Reading: At regular (configurable) intervals, the application checks RSS feeds from skate sites (currently The Berrics) for new stories.

Intelligent Filtering: Each article is analyzed. If the title or content matches one of a user's saved keywords, the article is selected for notification.

Duplicate Handling: The system keeps track of already processed articles to avoid sending the same news multiple times.

HTML Email Sending: Users receive well-formatted HTML emails with the details of the news found.

API Documentation with Swagger: The API is self-documented and testable through the Swagger UI interface.

üèÅ How to Get Started
---------------------

Prerequisites:

JDK 21 or higher

Apache Maven

A Gmail account with an App Password for sending emails.


Configuration
Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:danotoriousflaco101/skateFeed.git
cd skateFeed

Configure email credentials:
Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file. You need to edit the email sending section with your actual data.

# Enter your full Gmail address here
spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com

# Enter the 16-character password generated by Google here
spring.mail.password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Running the Application
You can run the application using the Maven wrapper provided by Spring Boot:

./mvnw spring-boot:run

The application will be running at http://localhost:8080.


‚öôÔ∏è Using the API
----------------

Once the application is running, you can start interacting with the API to subscribe to the service.


</br>
<p>
<strong>SWAGGER UI</strong>
</p>
</br>

The easiest way to test the API is through the Swagger UI interface.

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

You will see the POST /api/subscriptions endpoint.

Click on "Try it out" and enter a JSON object in the request body to subscribe.

Example JSON request:

{
  "email": "your.name@example.com",
  "keywords": [
    "primitive",
    "new balance numeric"
  ]
}


</br>
<p>
<strong>H2 CONSOLE</strong>
</p>
</br>

For development, you can access a web console to inspect the in-memory database. 


1. Make sure these properties are in your application.properties:

spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console

2. Go!
